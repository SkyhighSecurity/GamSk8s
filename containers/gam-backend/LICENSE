5.1 Payment. If You purchased Software license(s) through an Authorized Partner, Your payment 
obligations are exclusively between You and the Authorized Partner. If You have purchased
Software license(s) directly from Us, You agree to pay Us the license fees for the Software within 
thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Late payments are subject to interest of one and one-half percent 
(1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. All payment obligations 
are non-cancelable and non-refundable. If You consider an invoice to be incorrect, You must 
contact Us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice to request an adjustment or credit.
5.2 Transaction Taxes. If You purchase Software license(s) directly from Us, You agree to pay all 
applicable transaction taxes, including sales and use taxes, value added taxes, duties, customs, 
tariffs, and other government-imposed transactional charges however designated (and any related 
interest or penalty) on amounts payable by You under this Agreement (“Transaction Taxes”). We
will separately state on invoices the Transaction Taxes that We are required to collect from You
under applicable law. You will provide proof of any exemption from Transaction Taxes to Us at 
least fifteen (15) Business Days before the due date for paying an invoice. If We do not collect the 
required Transaction Taxes from You but are subsequently required to remit the Transaction Taxes 
to any taxing authority, You will promptly reimburse Us for the Transaction Taxes, including any 
accrued penalty or interest charges if the failure to timely collect and remit was not due to 
Company’s fault.
5.3 Withholding Taxes. All payments due will be made free and clear and without deduction for any 
present and future taxes imposed by any taxing authority. If You are required by applicable law to 
deduct or withhold income taxes from amounts payable to Us under this Agreement (“Withholding 
Taxes”), You will remit, and provide Us with evidence that You have remitted the Withholding 
Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and paid the remaining net amount. You will provide 
written notice to Us of Your intent to withhold (including details of the amounts and legal basis for 
Withholding Taxes) at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the due date for any payments under 
this Agreement and will cooperate with Us to reduce any Withholding Taxes. If We provide You
with valid and official documentation issued by the relevant taxing authority for a lower rate of 
Withholding Taxes, then You will apply the lower rate.
5.4 If You purchase Software license(s) through an Authorized Partner, the obligations regarding 
Transaction Taxes or Withholding Taxes will be the exclusive responsibility of the Authorized 
Partner or You, and the terms in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 do not apply as between Company and You.
5.5 Income Taxes. Each Party is responsible for its own income taxes or taxes based on gross revenues 
or gross receipts.
5.6 Software Deployment Verification. No more than once per year, We may request that You provide 
to Us, within thirty (30) days of Our request, either (a) a systems report (if the Software You have 
enables You to generate such a report) or (b) an accurate Software deployment verification report 
for the Software (if the Software You have does not contain the technical features to generate a 
systems report). You acknowledge that the systems report is based on technological features of the 
Software that provide Software deployment verification. If the systems report or Your prepared 
Software deployment verification report indicates that You are out of compliance with the license 
terms of Your Grant Letter and this Agreement, You agree to purchase the additional licenses and 
pay Us the applicable reinstatement fees associated with the licenses and Support. We may also 
charge You out-of-compliance fees.

6.1 Each Party acknowledges that it may have access to Confidential Information of the other Party in 
connection with this Agreement, and that each Party’s Confidential Information is of substantial 
value to the Disclosing Party, which could be impaired if it were improperly disclosed to third 
parties or used in violation of this Agreement.
6.2 Confidential Information as used in this Agreement means any information (regardless of the 
form of disclosure or the medium used to store or represent it) of a Party (“Disclosing Party”), 
including trade secrets and technical, financial, or business information, data, ideas, concepts, or 
know-how, that:
(a) is designated as “confidential” or by similar words by the Disclosing Party at the time of 
disclosure and, if oral or visual, is confirmed as confidential by the Disclosing Party in 
writing within fifteen (15) days of disclosure; or
(b) the receiving party (“Recipient”) should reasonably have considered to be confidential 
under the circumstances surrounding disclosure.
However, Confidential Information does not include any information that:
(a) written records demonstrate was lawfully acquired by or previously known to the Recipient 
independent of the Disclosing Party;
(b) is received from a third-party without restrictions on its use or disclosure and not by 
inadvertence or mistake;
(c) is or has become disseminated to the public through no fault of the Recipient and without 
violation of the terms of this Agreement or other obligation to maintain confidentiality; or
(d) is created independently by the Recipient without breach of this Agreement, including any 
obligation of confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party.
6.3 Each Recipient of Confidential Information under this Agreement must:
(a) keep the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information confidential and protect it at least to 
the same extent it protects its own Confidential Information and to the same extent that a 
reasonable person would protect such Confidential Information;
(b) not use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in any way for its own account or 
the account of any third-party except to perform its duties, exercise its rights, or is otherwise 
authorized under this Agreement; and
(c) not disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except to perform its duties or 
exercise its rights under this Agreement or as otherwise authorized under this Agreement, 
provided that:
(i) any disclosure made to the Recipient’s employees, contractors, or agents is on a needto-know basis; and
(ii) the Recipient’s employees, contractors, or agents in receipt of the Confidential 
Information are under an obligation of confidentiality no less stringent than that set 
forth in this section.
6.4 Notwithstanding the restrictions in Section 6.2, if the Recipient is required to disclose any of the 
Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information by law, such as in response to a subpoena or 
requirement of any regulator, court, arbitral, administrative, or legislative body, the Recipient must:
(a) where reasonably possible and permitted, immediately provide written notice to the 
Disclosing Party of the required disclosure to give the Disclosing Party an opportunity to 
move for a protective order or otherwise prevent the disclosure;
6. Confidentiality.

(b) disclose only the minimum amount of Confidential Information required to satisfy the legal 
obligation; and
(c) assert and take proper steps with the body requiring disclosure to maintain the 
confidentiality of the Confidential Information to be disclosed.
6.5 You will immediately, and at least within seventy-two (72) hours, notify Us if Confidential 
Information is used or disclosed in breach of this Agreement. As monetary damages may not be 
sufficient relief if anyone violates or threaten to violate the terms of this section, We are
immediately entitled to enforce Our rights by specific performance or injunction proceedings, in 
addition to any other rights or remedies We may have.
6.6 Upon the Disclosing Party’s request and upon termination of this Agreement (unless agreed 
otherwise by the Parties at the time), each Party will return, destroy, or delete permanently (at the 
Disclosing Party’s election) the other Party’s Confidential Information.
6.7 On termination of this Agreement, the Recipient must continue to keep the Disclosing Party’s 
Confidential Information confidential for five (5) years in accordance with this Section 6.

10.1 Customer Indemnification Obligations. You shall indemnify and defend Us, Our Affiliates, and 
Our officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents (each an “Indemnified Party”) against 
any claims, liabilities, and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorney fees) that an 
Indemnified Party incurs as a result of, or in connection with:

year period from the date of delivery of the Software to You.
10.3 Indemnification Procedure. The indemnified party (“Indemnitee”) will: (a) provide prompt 
written notice to the indemnifying party (“Indemnitor”) of the claim (provided that the failure to 
provide timely notice that prejudices the Indemnitor will relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations 
under this section to the extent the Indemnitor has been prejudiced and the failure to provide timely 
notice will relieve the Indemnitor of any obligation to reimburse the Indemnitee for its attorney’s 
fees incurred prior to notification); (b) reasonably cooperate in connection with the defense or 
settlement of the claim; and (c) give the Indemnitor sole control over the defense and settlement of 
the claim, provided that any settlement of a claim will not include a specific performance obligation 
or admission of liability by the Indemnitee.

and data loss. You may use information about the Evaluation Software gathered from Your use 
solely for evaluation purposes and must not provide that information to any third parties. The 
General Restrictions in Section 2.6 apply. If You fail to destroy the Evaluation Software after the 
evaluation period has expired, We may, at our discretion, invoice You in an amount equal to the
then-current list price for the Software and You agree to pay such invoice upon receipt.

Sections 11.1 (with all references to “Evaluation Software” being replaced with “Beta Software”) 
and 11.3 apply. We have no obligation to You to further develop or publicly release the Beta 
Software. Support is not available for Beta Software. Upon Our request, You agree to provide 
feedback regarding testing and use of the Beta Software, including error or bug reports. You grant 
Us a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, copy, distribute and make

components included with the Software are redistributed by Us under the terms of the applicable 
FOSS Code license for such component. Your receipt of FOSS Code components from Us under

components included with Software are included with or referenced in the Software’s 
Documentation.
12.1 The Software or Support may employ applications and tools to collect Personal Data, sensitive data
